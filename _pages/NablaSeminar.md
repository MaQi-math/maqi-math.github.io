    <h3>2025 Oct.27 , Speaker: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/gh-aprameya/">Aprameya Girish Hebbar</a></h3>
    <p><strong>Title: Rotational Symmetry in Riemannian Manifolds  </strong></p>
    <p>Abstract: In this talk, we will explore the structure of n-dimensional Riemannian manifolds admitting a smooth, effective SO(n) action by isometries, aka rotationally symmetric manifolds. We first characterize this symmetry using Killing fields. We then discuss how SO(3) and O(3) actions induce a local warped product structure for the metric in dimension 3. Finally, we will motivate Brendle's ε-symmetry and its role in the classification of 3-dimensional ancient solutions to the Ricci flow. </p>
