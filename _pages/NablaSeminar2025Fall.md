## Grad Analysis Seminar at Rutgers University

Grad Analysis $\nabla$ Seminar is a graduate seminar at Rutgers University, Department of Mathematics, Orgnized by Qi Ma since Nov. 2024.

This page is for seminars held in 2025 Fall. This semester we meet regularly on Monday at 5:00 p.m. in the Mathematics Graduate Lounge (Hill 701). We are looking for speakers. Please let me, Aprameya or Anupam know if you want to give a talk.

To see seminars in other semesters, please refer to [Nabla](../_pages/NablaSeminar.md).

    <h3>2025 Nov.10, Speaker: Sammy Thiagarajan</h3>
    <p><strong>Title: The Bernoulli/Alt-Caffarelli Problem  </strong></p>
    <p>Abstract: The Bernoulli/Alt-Caffarelli Problem is a variation of the Laplace equation in which the energy functional includes a penalty term on the positivity set. This leads to intriguing behaviors of the free boundary—the boundary of the zero set. In this talk, we discuss the optimal regularity of minimizers, showing that they are Lipschitz. We then prove a non-degeneracy estimate and, time permitting, explore density estimates and the regularity of the free boundary. </p>

    <h3>2025 Nov.03, Speaker: Hussein</h3>
    <p><strong>Title: Heat Kernels and Trace Asymptotics  </strong></p>
    <p>Abstract: To analysts, the heat kernel plays an important role as the propagator or fundamental solution of the heat equation, providing regularity estimates and smoothness for parabolic PDEs. However, its efficacy extends far beyond analytic questions. The heat kernel, the spectral profile of its associated Laplacian, and the asymptotic expansion of its trace provide a salient tool connecting PDEs, topology, geometry and spectral theory. My talk will be a gentle overview of its key role within several familiar phenomena, avoiding much technical detail and, hopefully, providing insight to its unification of analysis, geometry and topology rather than just an analytic trick. </p>

    <h3>2025 Oct.27 , Speaker: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/gh-aprameya/">Aprameya Girish Hebbar</a></h3>
    <p><strong>Title: Rotational Symmetry in Riemannian Manifolds  </strong></p>
    <p>Abstract: In this talk, we will explore the structure of n-dimensional Riemannian manifolds admitting a smooth, effective SO(n) action by isometries, aka rotationally symmetric manifolds. We first characterize this symmetry using Killing fields. We then discuss how SO(3) and O(3) actions induce a local warped product structure for the metric in dimension 3. Finally, we will motivate Brendle's ε-symmetry and its role in the classification of 3-dimensional ancient solutions to the Ricci flow. </p>

    <h3>2025 Oct.20 , Speaker: Anupam Nayak</h3>
    <p><strong>Title: Generic regularity of minimal surfaces  </strong></p>
    <p>Abstract: The famous Plateau's problem asks if there is a (smooth) area minimizing hypersurface with prescribed (smooth) boundary. By the Direct Method, the existence of some (possibly unsmooth) area minimizing hypersurface is "easy".  The hard part is to then show smoothness. In ambient dimensions upto 7, one (not me!) can show smoothness, but there is a counterexample to smoothness in ambient dimension 8: The Simons cone. Are such counterexamples special, that is, can they be perturbed away generically? In ambient dimension 8 (and also in 9,10, and 11), yes! I'll sketch the proof (due to Hardt-Simon) in dimension 8 (and time permitting, also in dimension 9,10, and 11 (due to Chodosh, Mantoulidis, Schulze, and Wang)). </p>

    <h3>2025 Oct.13 , Speaker: Erik Bahnson</h3>
    <p><strong>Title: The “simple” equation for a system of interacting Bosons  </strong></p>
    <p>Abstract:  In this talk, I will discuss the “simple” equation, a non-linear integro-differential equation which has been recently studied by Ian Jauslin, Eric Carlen and Elliot Lieb. I will show an existence result. Along the way, we will discuss tools from functional analysis, including contraction semigroups, the Hille-Yosida Theorem and the Kato-Rellich Theorem. </p>

    <h3>2025 Sept.29 , Speaker: <a href="https://nilavam.github.io/">Nilava Metya</a></h3>
    <p><strong>Title: An elementary proof of Pisier's inequality  </strong></p>
    <p>Abstract: We'll give an elementary and constructive proof of Pisier’s inequality, which is central in the study of normed spaces and has important applications in convex geometry. Along the way, we will discuss tools of harmonic analysis.</p>

    <h3>2025 Sept.22 , Speaker: Junyoung Park</h3>
    <p><strong>Title: On the interior Holder estimate for parabolic equation </strong></p>
    <p>Abstract: In this talk, I will discuss the Krylov Safanov estimates for parabolic equations. The estimate gives us an interior holder continuity of solution to parabolic equations in nondivergence form. We will prove the estimate by first establishing a weak Harnack inequality. Then by applying the Harnack inequality, we will obtain an oscillation decay which leads to the desired holder estimate. </p>

    <h3>2025 Sept.15 , Speaker: Dana Zilberberg</h3>
    <p><strong>Title: The Fractional Helmholtz Equation </strong></p>
    <p>Abstract: The main focus of my talk will be the Fractional Helmholtz Equation (a non local PDE), and in particular the question of a proper condition at infinity to ensure the uniqueness of the solution. I will briefly talk about the fractional Laplacian and a few of its properties, then I will tell you how to compute the Green's function of the fractional Helmholtz equation and finally I will spend some time sketching the uniqueness of the solution to this equation. </p>
