    <p><strong>Title: The monotonicity formula for energy minimizing maps </strong></p>
    <p>Abstract: In this talk, we will define energy minimizing maps and introduce key examples. Then, we will derive the associated variational formulae. A central theme of the talk will be the monotonicity formula: we will explore its significance and highlight its appearance in related geometric contexts such as minimal surfaces, mean curvature flow, and Ricci flow. We will then prove the monotonicity formula for energy minimizing maps. Finally, we will define the density function, introduce tangent maps, and discuss the role of monotone quantities in the study of regularity and singularities.</p>

    <p><strong>Title: Unique continuation for elliptic PDEs</strong></p>
    <p>Abstract: In complex analysis we learn that if a holomorphic function is zero on a nonempty open set, then it is identically zero on its domain. The proof is due to analyticity so the same result follows for harmonic functions. As solutions to elliptic pde mimic harmonic functions, we hope that we can prove similar results. Indeed, we will look at the Garofalo Lin proof of strong unique continuation for solutions to divergence form elliptic pde with lipschitz coefficients by means of an Almgren frequency formula. Like many monotonicity formulas, this proof was then built upon to answer many questions relating to the geometric structure of solutions.</p>

    <p><strong>Title: The Li-Yau Harnack Inequality</strong></p>
    <p>Abstract: The Harnack inequality, in its classical form, provides a way to compare the values of the positive solution at different points. In their 1986 seminal paper, Peter Li and Shing-Tung Yau introduced a revolutionary differential form of the Harnack inequality for the heat equation on Riemannian manifolds, now known as the Li-Yau Harnack (LYH) inequality. This differential inequality is very important in geometric analysis and they crop up in Hamilton's analysis of the Ricci flow on surfaces as well. In this talk I will discuss the proof of LYH inequality first on closed manifolds, then on open subsets of \R^n and finally on a complete non-compact manifold, and will obtain classical Harnack inequality as a corollary. </p>

    <h3>2025 Apr.4 , Speaker: Junyoung Park </h3>
    <p><strong>Title: Huisken’s theorem on the evolution of closed convex solutions under mean curvature flow </strong></p>
    <p>Abstract: Mean curvature flow is a geometric evolution equation which deforms a given hypersurface by its mean curvature vector, and has been extensively studied in the past several decades in the hopes of understanding the long time behavior of the flow. In this talk, we discuss Huisken’s theorem which completely describes the evolution of closed convex hypersurfaces in Euclidean space. We will discuss several proofs of this classical result, and highlight the key ideas behind each method.</p>

    <p><strong>Title:  Elliptic Boundary Value Problems </strong></p>
    <p>Abstract: In this talk we will study linear elliptic boundary value problems in their most general sense. We will answer questions like “what does it even for a distributional solution of Laplace psi=f to satisfy a boundary condition, when distributions may fail to have a trace!” I will also give some explicit applications of the closed graph theorem.</p>

    <p><strong>Title: Minimizers for the Area Functional (continued)</strong></p>
    <p>Abstract: The area functional is of linear growth in the gradient, so (cf. my previous talk) the natural space to pose the corresponding minimization problem is BV. We'll now try to show that this minimization problem is actually well posed by proving the lower semicontinuity theorem by Ambrosio-Dal Maso.</p>

    <h3>2025 Feb.21 , Speaker: Owen Drummond</h3>
    <p><strong>Title: Curvature, Stability, and Scalar Rigidity in Minimal Surface Theory.</strong></p>
    <p>Abstract: This talk will explore the interplay between energy estimates, curvature bounds, and rigidity results for minimal surfaces. The starting point will be Bernstein's theorem, which provides sufficient condition for a minimal graph of a function in $R^3$ to be a flat plane. Then, we will examine the relationship between energy bounds and curvature, including a key theorem of Schoen and Choi, which provide critical analytic control over the geometry of minimal surfaces. Building on this foundation, we will discuss Daniel Stern’s recent work, which reframes stability in terms of harmonic maps and provides a novel perspective on scalar curvature and minimal surface analysis. Finally, we will examine the famous theorem of Schoen and Yau, which reveals topological constraints on stable minimal surfaces. We will compare two distinct proofs of this theorem: one using the stability inequality and the other relying purely on Stern’s harmonic map framework. Together, these results highlight the deep connections between stability, curvature, and the analytic methods that underpin our understanding of minimal surfaces.</p>

    <p><strong>Title: Generalising the Riemann Mapping Theorem to Several Complex Variables.</strong></p>
    <p>Abstract: The Riemann Mapping Theorem is a fundamental result of the theory of one complex variable that classifies all simply connected domains up to biholomorphism. However, once one moves to just two complex variables, it is a famous result due to Poincaré that there cannot exist a biholomorphism between the unit ball and the unit polydisc. In this talk, we will describe some notions specific to several complex variables and introduce the Caratheodory and Kobayashi metrics. These distance-decreasing metrics, as we shall see, allow us to "measure" the failure of the Riemann Mapping Theorem. To finish, we will look at some generalisations of the mapping theorem to the higher dimensional setting.</p>

    <p><strong>Title: Compactness and Limits of Energy for Origami</strong></p>
    <p>Abstract: How does material choice affect the work needed to fold origami? In this talk, I'll present the basic modeling for elastic materials, and the progress I've made towards a Gamma convergence result. I'll show some theorems and open problems in my project. This talk will show some commonalities and differences between variational and classical PDE methods, and review some BV theory and GMT in service of the problem.</p>

    <p><strong>Title: Introduction to Stationary Navier-Stokes Equation and Leray's Theory.</strong></p>
    <p>Abstract: Navier-Stokes Equation describes the flow of incompressible viscous fluid. In this talk, I will introduce the stationary Navier-Stokes equation and some classical work in the study of Navier-Stokes equation, such as Helmholtz decomposition, Leray-Schauder Theorem, and invading domain method. I will try to prove some basic existence theorems from Leray's Thm. Some recent results and open problems will also be presented if time permitted.</p>

    <h3>2025 Jan.24 , Speaker: <a href="https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~laf230/">Lawrence Frolov</a></h3>
    <p><strong>Title: Must there be a boundary condition?</strong></p>
    <p>Abstract: When solving parabolic/hyperbolic evolution equations in some region \Omega of \mathbb{R}^n, we are typically equipped with two things: initial data which holds at t=0 and a boundary condition which holds for all t>0. It's no surprise that we need initial data to solve for the evolution. The purpose of this talk is to ask: must there be a boundary condition? Given a one-parameter family of operators W(t):L^2(\Omega) to L^2(\Omega) with W(t)\psi satisfying the evolution equation in \Omega for all \psi, can we say that W(t)\psi must satisfy a boundary condition for all t>0? Does it even make sense to ask this question, given that these are L^2 functions and the boundary condition takes place on a measure zero subset of \Omega? In this talk we will answer this question and more for certain linear evolution equations motivated by quantum mechanics.</p>
